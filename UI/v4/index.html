		To participate in this testing activity, we would require you to perform the following: <br>
		1. You will enter your login credentials in Facebook. This part is handled by Facebookâ€™s technology; we do not have access to your password and email addresses. <br>
		2. You will/may need to approve the permissions which will allow the software to access your Facebook data, for use in generating your biography. These permissions will allow the system to access your personal information as well as your posts in Facebook. <br>
		3. The software will then generate a life story about you, detailing some things about yourself as well as the things you like on Facebook. Please carefully examine and review the story that is generated. <br>
		4. You will have the option to save the generated story for future use in a text file. You will be responsible for keeping the file and/or its dissemination. <br>
		5. After using the software to generate your biography, you will answer an evaluation form and participate in a short interview to tell us about your experience and your feedback regarding the resulting story.
		<br><br>
		Your feedback to us regarding your experience will be used to determine the correctness of the software in key areas, namely: <br>
		1. Ensuring that only those information that you made public and had approved for use in this research will show up in the generated story; <br> 
		2. Validating the appropriateness and correctness (in terms of grammar) of the language used in the generated story; <br>
		3. The generated story is coherent and has good content based on the extracted information; and finally, <br>
		4. The story is interesting to read.
		<br><br>
		Note that we will not perform any video nor audio recordings while you are using the software and doing the debriefing interview. Upon your consent, the generated story will be stored for use in research purposes only. For confidentiality, we will anonymize the generated story by removing any names and replacing these with placeholders. After storing the generated story, we will show a proof that the anonymized story is indeed the one stored in our system.
